# SGControl

Various C- and Python-based control scripts for the Keysight/Agilent E4438C
Signal Generator. These tools are for LAN-based control. Note that the files
getopt.c and lanio.c are copies of the code originally presented in the
Keysight document number E4400-90505, and I make no claim for credit for them.
